# GeneVista
# **GeneVista** is a user-friendly, browser-based bioinformatics web server developed by **Rushabh Wakade**, a Master's student at **DES Pune University**, as part of his academic mini-project. Designed to assist students, educators, and researchers, GeneVista enables essential tasks like **NCBI sequence retrieval**, **pairwise alignment** (Global & Local), and **DNA/RNA to protein translation**, with features such as customizable scoring, GenBank metadata viewing, and downloadable outputs. Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Biopython**, and **Pandas**, it offers seamless access to biological databases without requiring installations. The platform reflects Rushabhâ€™s passion for **structural bioinformatics**, **genomic analysis**, and **tool development**, and continues to evolve with planned additions like **BLAST integration**, **FASTA uploads**, and **GC-content visualization**. The project was guided and supported by **Dr. Kushagra Kashyap**, Assistant Professor (Bioinformatics), whose mentorship played a pivotal role in shaping its scientific and technical direction.
